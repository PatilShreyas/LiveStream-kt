LiveStream is a data holder class which can observe ***change*** of data in real-time and ***emit values*** too. Unlike other observables, LiveStream uses different approach. Here's emitter subscriber pattern. It's developed in Kotlin and fully compatible with Java.

## üí° Introduction
`LiveStream` is different than any other data observables. As compared to Android Architecture Component's [`LiveData`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/LiveData.html) it's totally different. In `LiveData`, you need to share the instance and then you need to add observer to listen for changes. It's useful in `ViewModel` to share data.
`LiveStream` is useful in background and UI data sharing. Here, you need to subscribe to data stream and just need to **emit data values** and **subscribe data stream** from anywhere in the application using multiple instances of `LiveStream`.

For e.g. 
You have following classes in app- 
- UI Class - `MainActivity`
- Service Class - `BackgroundService`

To share data in both classes, you will just need to add subscriber in UI class (MainActivity). In MainActivity, you'll subscribe to ***`httpResponse`*** stream.
In `BackgroundService` class, whenever you want to share data, you will just need to emit data on stream - ***`httpResponse`***.
Then, those who subscribed for `httpResponse` data stream will be dispatched on value emission.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting Started
This library is fully compatible with **Java**. Here we've demonstrated using Kotlin.

### Add Dependency
Add below dependency in [`build.gradle`](app/build.gradle) of your app module.

Latest Build - ![Bintray](https://img.shields.io/bintray/v/patilshreyas/maven/dev.shreyaspatil:LiveStream-kt?style=flat-square)
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'dev.shreyaspatil:LiveStream-kt:0.1'
}
```

### Initialize `LiveStream` Class
`LiveStream` is a generic class. You can create instance as below.

```kotlin
        private val liveStream = LiveStream<String>()
```

### Subscribe to Stream / Add Observer
`LiveStream` event will be dispatched when data is changed. See below code to add observer / subscriber.

*Imagine, this code is in UI class of Android (e.g. MainActivity). Whenever value from background task (e.g. Service Class) is emitted, subscriber will listen live changes in data.*

```kotlin
        val observer = liveStream.subscribe("httpResponse") { response ->
            showToast("This is HTTP response: $response")
        }
```
`LiveStream#subscribe()` method will return instance of `StreamObserver`. This instance will be useful to unsubscribe from `LiveStream`.

### Emit Values/Data
You can emit values in `LiveData` from anywhere in the application. See below code.

#### From Main Thread :
To emit values from main thread, use `LiveStream#set()` method.
```kotlin
        val response = getResponse()
        liveStream.set("httpResponse", response)
```

#### From Other Thread :
To emit values from other thread, use `LiveStream#post()` method.
```kotlin
        val response = getResponse()
        liveStream.post("httpResponse", response)
```

### Unsubscribe 
To unsubscribe stream observer, use `LiveStream#unsubscribe()` method. It has to pass instance of `StreamObserver` which is obtained when you called `subscribe()` method. See below code.

```kotlin
    override fun onStop() {
        super.onStop()
        liveStream.unsubscribe(observer)
    }
```
