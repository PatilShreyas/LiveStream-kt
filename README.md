LiveStream is a data holder class which can observe ***change*** of data in real-time and ***emit values*** too. Unlike other observables, LiveStream uses different approach. Here's emitter subscriber pattern. It's developed in Kotlin and fully compatible with Java.

## Getting Started ‚ö°Ô∏è
This library is fully compatible with **Java**. Here we've demonstrated using Kotlin.

### Add Dependency
Add below dependency in [`build.gradle`](app/build.gradle) of your app module.
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.shreyaspatil:LiveStream-kt:0.1'
}
```

### Initialize `LiveStream` Class
`LiveStream` is a generic class. You can create instance as below.

```kotlin
        private val liveStream = LiveStream<String>()
```

### Subscribe to Stream / Add Observer
`LiveStream` event will be dispatched when data is changed. See below code to add observer / subscriber.

*Imagine, this code is in UI class of Android (e.g. MainActivity). Whenever value from background task (e.g. Service Class) is emitted, subscriber will listen live changes in data.*

```kotlin
        val observer = liveStream.subscribe("httpResponse") { response ->
            showToast("This is HTTP response: $response")
        }
```
`LiveStream#subscribe()` method will return instance of `StreamObserver`. This instance will be useful to unsubscribe from `LiveStream`.
